    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I’m so in love with this blondie recipe. I felt it was a very important recipe to get just right, because the texture and flavor were very specific in my mind. I wanted that deep, almost butterscotch-like, flavor from the brown sugar. I wanted white chocolate (because regular chocolate feels too much like a cookie bar to me) and something chewy, dense and tender, like a great brownie. But not crumbly and dry.</p>

    <p>This recipe turned out even better than I could’ve imagined. A friend, who tries a lot of my treats, declared them to be her favorite so far. They really are even better than you expect them to be, and they stay tender and chewy for several days without drying out. The best!</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 2/3 cups (217g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (168g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (337g) packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (30g) cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (253g) white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 8-inch square metal (not glass or ceramic) baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some over hanging on two sides for easy removal from the pan later.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder and salt to a medium sized bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the melted butter and brown sugar. Whisk together to combine. Let cool until just warm.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract and whisk vigorously until well combined and smooth, about 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Fold in the dry ingredients, then fold in the white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the edges are lightly golden but the center still jiggles slightly, about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely, then use the parchment paper to lift them out of the pan. Cut into squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. Best if eaten within 4-5 days.</li>
    </ol>
